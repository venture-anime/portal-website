Thinking that living in another country sounds like a fun challenge, she studied Japanese at a language school until 20 and proceeded to work at a large international tech company in Tokyo.\nAs an extremely intelligent person, she gets easily bored of normal, everyday things and is mostly only interested in deep conversations and complex technological discussions.\nBecause of this lack of interest in most normal activities, she tends to do random (and sometimes reckless) things just for the sake of fun, which include randomly having a sex reassignment surgery, moving to Japan on a whim, and going to bars to seduce men but ending up telling them \"I used to be a man.\" and walking away.

    "character.sanosuke.reasonForApplication": "Sanosuke has always dreamed to change the world in his own way since he was a young child. Because of this, he diligently worked his way through school and managed to get a job at a large tech company to collect both engineering and business experience and knowledge. \nHowever, one day both of his parents died in an accident, and he received a large sum of money as inheritance.
